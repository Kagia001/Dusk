The files I use to change all my programs from light to dark mode depending on ambient light which I read from a LDR connected to a ATtiny. As it stands now, this is pretty much useless to anyone else as it depends on the config of other programs and the Gruvbox theme is hard-coded, but its here in case you want change it or use it as inspiration. If people want it, I might make this shitty C program a bit better by making it less dependant on other programs and able to use other themes.
